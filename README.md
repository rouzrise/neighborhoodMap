## Neighborhood Map Project Overview
Neighborhood Map is a final project completed within Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. 
This is a web application that allows you to find Railway Stations in Moscow.


## How to start

To start using App `git` clone or download it from [github](https://github.com/rouzrise/neighborhoodMap.git).

After cloning or downloading the App - `cd` to the folder in Terminal.
Be sure you have React installed locally and globally (also you'll need 'prop-types' and 'jquery' packages installed).

If you are not sure - just run 
`npm i --save prop-types react react-dom jquery` and `npm i --save-dev react-scripts`

After that run `npm start` to open the Browser tab with working App.

## What You can do with the App

#### Get the Google Map of Moscow with the Moscow Railway Stations set as Markers on it. 
It happens by default on loading app.

#### Filter Stations.
If clicking on hamburger menu - you get the list of Moscow Railway Stations.
Start typing in the Filter input section to filter stations by name.

#### Learn additional info about Stations.
If you click marker (or click on the list Item in side-menu) - the Infowindow will be opened for chosen Railway Station. It will contain the address and link to Foursquare page of selected location.
